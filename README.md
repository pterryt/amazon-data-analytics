# Amazon Reviews and Prices: Data Cleaning and Statistical Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that cleans and analyzes a dataset of Amazon reviews and prices, sourced from Kaggle: [Amazon Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset/data). The project leverages Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels.api`, and `scipy` to explore, clean, and model the data for actionable insights.

---

## Project Overview

The notebook performs the following key tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Correcting inconsistent formatting.
   - Removing duplicate entries.
   - Standardizing data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generating descriptive statistics.
   - Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.

3. **Preliminary Statistical Testing**
   - Conducting hypothesis testing to evaluate relationships and trends.
   - Using `scipy` to produce and interpret p-values for statistical significance tests.

4. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Modeling**
   - Building and fitting OLS regression models using `statsmodels.api`.
   - Assessing model fit and assumptions.
